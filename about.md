#About

PDC is a project intended to document the process of setting up system for secure distributed backup and files for personal use.

The initial goal is to have a easily repeatable process for setting up a Raspberry Pi 2 as a BitTorrent Sync peer. The Pi should then be able to placed in any trusted location, such as a family members house, to provide off-site backup of files. Using BitTorrent Sync allows for multuple redundancy.

The remotely located Pi will also need to have ssh running to provide remote administration and we will help ensure it remains reachable by attempting to use uPnP and NAT-PMP to create NAT port forwarding rules on the router.</p>

Once the initial requirements are met, we will attempt to remove any non-canonical dependencies and add additional functionality like OwnCloud.
