Well, after doing a bit of learning, master now has [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com) playbooks that configue a host to have two [lxc](https://linuxcontainers.org) containers one for running [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org) and another for running natman. I also have a slightly modified version of the [most official of all unofficial scripts for building a ubuntu image for a Raspberry Pi 2](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi) which pre-installs a few extra packages that PDC will need. I still need to write the getting starting instructions for the code and will probably add a pre-built version of the ubuntu image, for those that don't already have a linux machine running or just feel like skipping that step.
