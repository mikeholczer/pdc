Well it would seem that we have setback. I just tried to rebuid my test system from the instructions posted here again, and some of the packages have changed or are missing. There is one problem with upgrading the system, but the biggest problem is that the docker.io package is no longer available. I'm going to have to research what may have happened to it, but since [docker](http://docker.io) was never supposed to be supported on armhf (at least yet), I don't have high hopes in th near term. I'm probably going to have to work on building out the system without docker, which really isn't too big of a problem.

*Update:*I've found that the docker.io package has been removed from the debain jessie repository. I sent a message to [docker's](http://docker.io) support email to see if it will be coming back, or if we will have to move to sid.

*Update 2:*At [Peg + Cat](http://pbskids.org/peg/) say "Problem solved", at least I think. It looks like the docker.io package was just removed from the debian jessie repository. I'm still trying to figure out why, but in the mean time I have switched over to using [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) as the root OS for our Raspberry Pi 2. I have been able to get docker.io to install and I'm currently running the PDC scripts to ensure we don't loose any ground with this change. I'll have to update the main project page's getting started directions, but the good news it the system running with Ubuntu seems to be faster which is nice.
