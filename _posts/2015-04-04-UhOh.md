Well it would seem that we have setback. I just tried to rebuid my test system from the instructions posted here again, and some of the packages have changed or are missing. There is one problem with upgrading the system, but the biggest problem is that the docker.io package is no longer available. I'm going to have to research what may have happened to it, but since [docker](http://docker.io) was never supposed to be supported on armhf (at least yet), I don't have high hopes in th near term. I'm probably going to have to work on building out the system without docker, which really isn't too big of a problem.
