Well, we now have something that does something. I've updated main page of this site with instructions for getting a Raspberry Pi 2 from box to running with [Docker](http://docker.io) installed.

From here we need to add Docker files for creating images for the [BitTorrent Sync](http://getsync.com) and [natman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natman). Natman is the utility we will use for uPnP and NAT-PMP port fowarding.

But that's for another day...
