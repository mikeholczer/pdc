I've added a new Dockerfile for to bring [Natman](https://github.com/Marak/natman) to the game. [Natman](https://github.com/Marak/natman) will allow us to automatically map a public port on our router to port 22 on the [Raspberry Pi 2](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/). This assumes that the router support either [uPnP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play) or [NAT-PMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_Port_Mapping_Protocol) which many or most do. This will ensure that we have access to administer the device at its final location without having to manually configure the routers of our loved ones.

Unfortunately, I still need to figure out how to pass configuration into our containers, so in the mean time the natman Dockerfile need to be customized to include the public port to request for the port mapping and the local address of the router. I don't want the project to standardize on a specific port, as having a known port number that gets forwarded to port 22 would be a security concern, if a vulnerablity in ssh is found and the local address of the router will vary from network to network.

Down the road, I intend to have the setup scripts pick a random port and report it back to the user as well as detect the local address of the router, but first we will dockerize and get [BitTorrent Sync](http://getsync.com) setup and running, so stay tuned...
