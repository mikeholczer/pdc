After working through the issues I had with [Docker](http://docker.io) and looking more at the problems to solve, I have determined that a combination of [lxc](https://linuxcontainers.org) and [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com) are better suited for the needs of this project. I do have a bit more reading and poking around with them to confirm this as the new plan and will keep the blog updated with progress.
