It's all begining to come together! I've updated the setup.sh script to clone the repo and start building docker images which proves out the pattern for getting most of the way to v1. Next steps will be adding the rest of the docker image builds and then I can move on to providing a good pattern for supplying [BitTorrent Sync](http://getsync.com) with its config.
